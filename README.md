# docker-golang-dojo

A [Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo) docker image to develop golang projects. Based on official golang image.

## Specification

This image has installed:
 * golang `1.11.0`
 * glide (dependency manager for golang)

## Usage
1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), if you haven't already.
2. [Install Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo#installation), it is a self-contained binary, so just place it somewhere on the `PATH`.
On **Linux**:
```bash
DOJO_VERSION=0.4.2
wget -O dojo https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo/releases/download/${DOJO_VERSION}/dojo_linux_amd64
sudo mv dojo /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dojo
```
3. Provide a Dojofile:
```toml
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="docker-ai-traders.com/golang-ide:1.0.0"
DOJO_WORK_INNER="/dojo/work/src/myproject"
```
4. Run `dojo` to start container with golang environment.

By default, current directory in docker container is [DOJO_WORK_INNER](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo#inner-working-directory),
 which defaults to `/dojo/work`.

Example commands:
```
glide install
go test
```

### Workspace

Golang has a particular workspace convention:
  * https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces
  * https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH
  * https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GithubCodeLayout

This is not very compliant with [Dojo](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo) conventions, because it expects to have single environment for multiple projects, while dojo is about having a specific environment for each project.

This image works around it anyway. We always set `GOPATH=/dojo/work` and provide proper directory layout.

You have 2 options here:
  1. keep 1 Dojofile for many golang projects. Your workspace will look like that:
  ```
  .git/
  bin/
  pkg/
  src/
    01-example/
      package1/
        some_go_file.go
        some_go_file_test.go
      package2/
        another_go_file.go
    02-abc/
      abc.go
  Dojofile
  ```
  Inside `golang-dojo` container, your workspace is mounted into `/dojo/work`.
  No need to set anything unusual in Dojofile.
  2. keep 1 Dojofile for 1 golang project. Your workspace will look like that:
  ```
  .git/
  package1/
    some_go_file.go
    some_go_file_test.go
  package2/
    another_go_file.go
  Dojofile
  ```
  You have to:
   * set `DOJO_WORK_INNER` in Dojofile to something under `/dojo/work/src`,
    e.g. `/dojo/work/src/github.com/user/hello`.

----

Whichever option you choose, the directories `/dojo/work/bin/` and `/dojo/work/pkg/` will be provided. In result, the compiled files `*.a` are available on docker host too.

### Configuration
Those files are used inside the docker image:

1. `~/.ssh/` -- is copied from host to dojo's home `~/.ssh`
1. `~/.ssh/config` -- will be generated on docker container start. SSH client is configured to ignore known ssh hosts.
2. `~/.gitconfig` -- if exists locally, will be copied
3. `~/.profile` -- will be generated on docker container start, in
   order to ensure current directory is [DOJO_WORK_INNER](https://github.com/ai-traders/dojo#inner-working-directory).
